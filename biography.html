<p>biography</p>
<p>Paul Edward Stothers (b. 1975, Wairoa, New Zealand) is an interdisciplinary artist who lives and works in Tāmaki Makaurau, Auckland.
His practice encompasses video, sound, costume, fashion and mixed media — often found outside a gallery context.
Stothers' work playfully recontextualises found media, emergent or obsolete internet technologies and popular culture.
