            <span style="font-weight: 400;">I Feel Sick!</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">There must be a dead rat floating in old bourbon somewhere. The room smelt awful. An epileptic jackhammer worked my dead skull. I tried to get my mouth working. Someone must have tossed cement into it and clamped it shut. I attempted to lift my torso and failed. The pillow felt like stone. Did they build the colosseum with these things?. Finally, I flung out an arm and found stale flat Coca-Cola. I took a swig of the sickly sweet nectar and then emptied the contents of the sorry can. Why is it so hot?. I looked down at my legs.&nbsp;</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
              <br>Hair slicked down like seal fur greased in gulf oil. A damp sheet for a friend. I felt terrible.&nbsp;<br>My phone bleeped.&nbsp;
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">A proud relentlessly chirpy broadcast. Its iridescent shell gleamed. It continued by imitating a dying sex toy. A grating throttle of batteries powering down against the faux bamboo of our&nbsp;</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ikea lowboy. A notification. From whom?. It was too early for an IRL rendezvous. About the fog of last night, no doubt. I took a glimpse.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan - ‘Check it out!’&nbsp;<br>Innocuous enough had not been for the grainy pixelated attachment. Four badly lit goons with condoms over their heads. One of those goons was I. A shameful frat boy stunt captured and broadcast into timelines far and wide. I had more pressing issues.&nbsp;<br>‘Were those latex condoms?’<br>Ryan - ‘How would I know?’<br>‘What brand were they?’ .<br>Ryan - ‘Ron Jeremy regulation 12...why the hell does that matter...it was hilarious.’
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t hilarious. I was allergic to latex. Exhibit A - The ‘Hindenburg Incident’. When I metamorphosed into a malfunctioning miscreant with a balloon penis. The decorous chat bubble vanished. Operation douche bag was in full swing. Progress 90% complete.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">What the hell happened last night? I called out to Sara in the adjacent room.<br>‘Sara?’<br>No response. She was fake tanning in front of the television. I tried again. A bawdy baritone tuned by shots of tequila and Marlboro Reds.<br>‘Saaaaaraaaa?’&nbsp;<br>“What?”<br>‘I need panadol.’<br>‘It’s in the draw.’<br>‘Which draw?’<br>‘The drawer next to you!’<br>There wasn’t a draw, thieves had stolen all the furniture. Climbed in the window at night when I was dreaming about drinking the Atlantic ocean.<br>‘There’s no Panadol in here!’<br>‘Take a proper look.’&nbsp;<br>‘Not here.’&nbsp;<br>‘There's a whole box shit-head!’&nbsp;<br>She was right, there was a box, it was hiding behind a wall of paranoia.<br>‘Got it.’<br>No response. I would have to go in cold. A dry swallow. I would need three or four. I deliberated whether to take all four at once. Was it even possible?. I pretended I was laid out in the jungle and some Admiral personally choppered in the analgesics. 'Fire them in Admiral' I said. It tasted like it should, terrible,&nbsp;
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">but dryer, like lead paint, scraped from an Edwardian villa.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Entertainment was paramount. I would need a remote. Any remote will do and I'd come up with my cellular. Futile. That device had already proved villainous. Anyway, I wasn’t about to ring anyone. What would I say, or more importantly what would they say?<br>"How was your night?”&nbsp;<br>I would have to lie and say -&nbsp;<br>‘Great!’&nbsp;<br>It wasn’t great. It wasn't anything. It ceased to exist. Another blackout. I had powered down at tequila number three. Navigated by torchlight over a Rum and Coke before the candle blew out at approximately 5 am. I called out to Sara again.<br>‘Room Service?’<br>No reply. I went in again. Bingo. The television remote, the one with forty thousand buttons. I can’t remember how to operate this thing at peak performance. Let's just hit some rubber and see what happens. Bingo, static. Shit. I bashed a few more buttons. Blue Screen. Shit. Let’s try blindfolded. Eureka. A pretty girl appeared. Skin the colour of an A4 sheet of paper. Legs like hypodermic needles. Click. Boom. An old western. Fossilised white men swinging their dicks around inside a saloon. Take an Old Fashioned and read a book. Chill out. You own a horse man, probably several. The last girl's parents sold their spare Mercedes so they could buy her a horse. Click. A movie. In colour. Die Hard. Is this a sign?. Die - Hard. Am I dying? like hard, a catastrophic shutdown of all the valves and pumps keeping me alive. Maybe it was the 'reassuring', 'your hardly dying', the sweet tones of a motherly figure, perhaps even my mother -<br>‘You're just hungover, you're hardly dying’.
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">The paracetamol had finally kicked in like jumper leads jolting a dead battery inside a Holden Barina. Click. Pause. Let’s get out of bed. I swung two legs around and out onto the tarmac. The floorboards wobbled. A giant cavern. Two mercurial hot dogs skinny dipping in vomit. 'Get back in bed' they laughed. I obliged, I had Bruce Willis. If he could save a building, he could save me. The drama unfolded. Bruce was soon bald and boring.&nbsp;</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t get through a movie. Not in this state. What was I thinking?</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">And then it hit me. The big explosion sound. It's not coming from the T.V.! It's coming from nowhere.&nbsp;</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinnitus from guitars shrieking out of speaker stacks. Sixty-hertz throbs in subterranean basements. The human ear. It has a bizarre memory recall. Shattered glass, guttural clunks, completely random. Hideous objects hurled at a garbage disposal unit. Cranked to ten. A jolting aural hallucination. A devil Dolby surround sound. It passes as quickly as it comes. It's invisible, you can't tell it to go away. A rollerskating elephant.&nbsp;</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Close your eyes. The ratatat recoil of a first-person shooter. It can't be turned off. It doesn't come from outside, it comes from within.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gasoline vapour wafted through the window. A raucous lawnmower scowled. The neighbourhood was chiming in. Frank!. The intangibly close next-door neighbour Frank. Out in his backyard in a pair of sandals and a sunburnt face streaked with zinc. His lawn had the best crew cut in town. It went to the barber once a week. On the weekends, when mortals dozed and dreamt of Eggs Benedict. Any neighbour in a kilometre radius now had permission to create as much machine noise as possible. And out they came. Trotted out like prize-winning ponies. The obnoxious chef up the back. Under his deciduous tree smugly relocating dead leaves. Handyman Harry, angle grinding a&nbsp; hunk of metal. In defiance, the upstairs neighbours cranked Limp Biscuit, cooked fake bacon and stomped about in steel cap boots. All I could do was lie there and take it all in. I began to wonder about a great many things, but mostly I just wondered what the hell was Sara doing out there? Playing chess with Silent Bob.&nbsp;</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">I would need to enquire.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Sara, what are you doing?’<br>‘Nothing.’<br>It wasn't - nothing, it was something. Something nefarious.&nbsp;<br>I needed a further line of enquiry.<br>‘Is it fun?’<br>‘I'm reading dick wad.’<br>Hmmm reading, reading what?. A manual on how to poison your boyfriend and dispose of the body. We didn't have the car for it. Only a lowly Barina. The Hatchback version. In the movies, they used sedans, big trunked sedans with a strip of wood panelling down the side. She would have to remove my legs. Hack them off. A garden shed implement. The hedge trimmer, maybe the axe. I was thankful we didn't own a chainsaw. I was on her scent.<br>‘Do we know anyone with a chainsaw?’<br>‘What?’<br>‘Do we know anyone with a chainsaw?’<br>‘What the hell for?’<br>‘To do some gardening?’<br>‘Why would we do that?’<br>‘Cut down that stupid tree.’<br>‘What tree?’<br>‘The ugly green tree?’<br>‘Go back to bed, Simon!’<br>Hmmm, a denialist. The only way she was hacking off my legs was if I was dead already. Both femur, hewn in a gory rage. So what about poison then. Powdered stuff like Anthrax, Brodifacoum, Cyanide, Strychnine. What about natural toxins no less capable of an early demise -&nbsp; the leaves of oleander, hemlock or foxglove. Take your pick. Clues?. What were they and what could a sleuth uncover from behind a duvet. I would need to develop a criminal profile. How did they do it on T.V?. I'm sure they left their beds. But I knew the suspect, intimately. An only child, a psychopath that tortured feral cats? I never saw her with a cat, she had got rid of them. Erased. Crossed out. Murdered!. I drew the duvet up closer to my eyes, shuddered and tried to think positive thoughts. She was kind. No, she wasn't. She hated almost everyone and everything. But I was certain she didn't hate me, until now.
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Sara, do you hate me?’<br>‘What kind of question is that?’<br>My voice raised like a toxic cop show detective.<br>"ANSWER THE QUESTION!"<br>‘Of course not loser, we're married.’<br>‘So.’<br>‘I'm not dumb enough to marry someone I hate.’<br>She had a point, she was not dumb. She was smart. Was she too smart?. Everyone knows serial killers are intelligent. I had all the evidence one needs. This case was going to trial. Attempted murder. But what was the motive?. Aha. The marriage. The deep tangle of mutual financial affairs.<br>‘What would you do if I died..like had an accident or something?’<br>‘Jesus Simon, what's with all these stupid questions?’<br>‘It's important, you know, I’d want you to be happy.’<br>``We'll up the life insurance then.’&nbsp;<br>She had fallen deep into my trap. A confession. I was under the duvet now, an ooze of warm urine manifested.&nbsp;
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">I feared for my life. If I just had the strength to get up and lock the door or better, escape. Out the window. Down the fire escape. With a passport and enough loot to get me to Costa Rica. I furiously tapped into my online merchant. $959.40. Wow!, I must have spent close to five hundred last night. I had more vexing problems. Costa Rica was out, the flights were too expensive. I could make it to the Gold Coast for a measly two hundred. Add in a Fillet ‘o’ Fish combo, airport transfers, a terrible magazine and I'd land with just south of seven hundred. People land in the Big Apple for less, live in cars, sell shampoo door to door and end up owing three private jets.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Simon?’&nbsp;<br>Dear God, voices from the other room.<br>‘You know you have work at two?’<br>The peak summer sweat turned cold. A pterodactyl swooped in. Picked me up by my soiled boxers and dangled me over a vast metropolis. Flailing limbs refracted in the triple glazed tower blocks. I tried to make sense of the time vortex. It began on Friday. One dollar Bourbons sucked through plastic straws. The chosen poison of&nbsp;
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">an embryonic moth-human. By Saturday afternoon I'd mutated into blubbering larvae. Crawling and creeping around the sorry streets, amongst the cigarette butts and drain stench. By Sunday nothing more than grotesque pupae.&nbsp;</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">A fragile lepidote crystalline shell.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no time to make sense of it all. I drew my hands to my face and peaked between the clammy webbing. ‘12.59 pm’. I lurched forward, blinked and opened my eyes hoping the clock had rewinded. It did not. I now had an hour and one minute to exhume the utilitarian self. To prepare for the nappy aromas and kiddy spit.&nbsp;</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">The snotty spoiled children of the middle classes and their incessant demands for ice cream.<br>I would not be reborn until next Friday, the intervening hour would prove crucial. I pushed everything to one side. The anxiety. The paranoia. The crushing sense of doom. Hello panic, nice of you to arrive. I went into auto-pilot. That is to say, I finally resolved to leave the bed. As shitty as I was, I wasn’t about to let down Tony Bartholomew and his Ice Cream empire.&nbsp;I tiptoed into the living room. Sara was reading on the sofa.&nbsp;
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Caught in the outfield by a giant mitt. A scuffed faux leather cocoon. She looked serene. I looked like masticated breakfast cereal. There wasn’t much time for small talk. Foolishly I engaged.&nbsp;<br>‘What are you reading?’<br>She lifted the book off her lap so I could glimpse the cover.<br>‘Redundant Lovers’. Hmm, should I have been offended? Maybe there were other lovers?<br>‘Am I the redundant lover?’<br>‘Maybe?’<br>Maybe. Redundant lovers don’t need maybe. Maybe I had erectile dysfunction, maybe the advanced stages of dementia. You need a memory to love and be loved. Sara let out a sly laugh.<br>‘Don't worry, it's not a self-help book dummy.’<br>And at that moment she peeled her eyes away from the book.
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">‘O.M.G Simon, your face.’<br>‘I know, I look hideous.’<br>‘No, it's all lumpy.’<br>I wasn’t about to look. One thing I had learned from the endless march of time. The inevitable decay. You didn't stare at it in a mirror. It only gets worse, never better. The balms and the creams, it's all a hoax. They only quicken the tempo. Drain the finances. Poverty is no friend to beauty. Embrace the crevices, swim in the valleys. Hold scars dear to your heart. At least they proved you were alive. Better to have tasted bitumen, spat blood, sliced nerve endings, cracked bones. Sara continued.<br>‘What is it?’<br>‘I have no idea, is it bad?’<br>The topography had burst, especially around my eyes and lips. Cloisters pumped up like old bicycle tyres.&nbsp;
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what the ends of my fingers told me as they encountered the visage. Strangely it felt pleasant,&nbsp;</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">like running your hand across fresh bubble wrap. The desire to pop was strong, but I would have withered into a corner like a rapidly deflated balloon. At this point, I could confess. The folly of four drunk fools.&nbsp;</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dick heads making dick jokes. Ryan was still maintaining it was ‘hilarious’. My own opinion transmuted into regret and embarrassment. Embarrassment I would now parade around for all to see. I needed an excuse.&nbsp;</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabies, from one of those toy dogs that socialites carry in Louis Vuitton handbags. It tried to rip the beef jerky right out of my mouth. Small dogs love salty snacks. Who could blame the cretin, it was on a diet of Fluffies and Water Crackers. Sara changed tack. A prompt.<br>‘Go look in a mirror.’<br>‘Is it really that bad?’<br>‘Simon.’<br>Nothing moved. Lips, legs, arms, my brain. A puppy doped up on vodka fumes.<br>‘Simon!’<br>It was now an order. I sulked off to the bathroom.&nbsp;
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">The mirror was offended. I could see it from the door jam. I backed up like a lost delivery truck. Back into the living room.&nbsp;<br>‘I think it’s some kind of allergic reaction.’<br>‘Do you think?’
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">The intervening minutes washed over me. A cold shower. A hurried and harrowed attempt to locate a work uniform.<br>Sara didn’t move, her brain ticking down the seconds until the monstrosity would leave. I called an Uber. My shift would begin in twenty minutes. I received the notification. A dread beep straight to the heart. I peeked out the window and saw the hearse. A green metallic Toyota sitting curbside.<br>‘Wish me luck.’<br>‘See ya.’
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dull throbbing didgeridoo trance seeped from the Toyota. A miasmic combination of mystical herbs wafting down the street.I hoped in the front. The driver was reclined so far back he could have been sleeping. Eyes hidden by wrap-around sunglasses. Arms hidden by tattoos. Face hidden by a ginger grey beard that crescendoed into a ponytail. He was sun-bronzed and wore clothes that resembled a sword fighter. A guru of some sort with a Celtic bent. At first, he did not speak, instead, he hummed, a disturbing low spiritual ohm in tune with his inner circadian rhythms. He drove with one hand, and then with no hands as he chinked some finger cymbals to a chorus of Tibetan throat singers. He got very excited during the breakdown. A sly gamelan played with the intensity of a cave-dwelling bat. Suddenly The GPS powered down. His worldly senses were put to the test. In the back streets of Goa, Thailand, Nepal, rural India, he would have been fine following a trail of spices. Green Lynn without GPS. He was screwed. Against better judgement, I decided to break the ice.<br>‘Smells nice?’<br>‘Ashwagandha, Indian ginseng...picked it up through my travels in the Gujarati province, have you been?’<br>I shook my head.<br>‘Where are you from..you know, originally?’ i said.<br>‘New Plymouth.’<br>He dipped his shades down his pointy nose.<br>“You seem to be suffering from inflammation”<br>Reluctantly I agreed.<br>‘Would you fancy a remedy?’<br>Before I had time to reply he pulled a vial from his MC Hammer pants and popped the miniature cork from the tiny bottle. Hair stood to attention. Nose hair. Arm Hair. Leg hair. It smelt so bad it might just work.<br>‘Apply liberally.’<br>I wrenched the vial from his grasp.<br>‘Hold your horses. This is some of the most powerful anti-inflammatory medicine not yet available on the black market.’<br>“Great”<br>‘No, Not great, dangerous.’
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">In great detail, he informed me the side effects were many and varied. The sermon ate up the remaining journey. He pumped the brakes outside my destination, tossed in three more tinctures and wished me luck.<br>And there I stood. Wobbly legged and dazed. A cold hard chain link fence clanging in a lonely wind. I looked around and then into the locked yard of Mr Licky headquarters. Rows of white vans streaked with pink. The dormant ice cream trucks of Mondays. I believed that I had lived Sunday. I had lived nothing. I felt warm again. My next shift was forty eight hours into the distant future. The present was a memory.&nbsp;
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked like shit, but strangely I felt great.</span></b>
